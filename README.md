# Meat raffle

What Starknet really needs is a meat raffle protocol: buy tickets and win raw meat (\*).

Disclosure: This is mainly a Cairo learning project. It requires random number generation in a Cairo contract and storage of data structures of custom types.

\* Actually just a JPEG of some raw meat tbh.

## Build and test

```
snforge
```

## OK cool so where can I buy a raffle ticket

Nowhere yet I'm still building it for goodness sake.
