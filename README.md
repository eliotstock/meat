# Meat raffle

What Starknet really needs is a meat raffle protocol: buy tickets and win NFTs depicting raw meat.

Disclosure: This is mainly a Cairo learning project. It requires random number generation in a Cairo contract and storage of data structures of custom types.

## Build and test

## Cool so where can I buy a raffle ticket

Nowhere yet I'm still building it for goodness sake.
